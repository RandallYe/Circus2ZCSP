# Circus2ZCSP
A translator from a [Circus](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/circus/) model to CSP ||b Z in terms of CSP || B. It is used in my research to model check Circus by linking to CSP || B, then use ProB to model check the resultant model.

This translator is developed based on Community Z Tools ([CZT](http://czt.sourceforge.net/)).

More information about its usage, its research context, and design can be found on its [Wiki](https://github.com/RandallYe/Circus2ZCSP/wiki).
