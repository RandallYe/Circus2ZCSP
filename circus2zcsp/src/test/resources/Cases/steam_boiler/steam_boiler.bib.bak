  review	= {CSP and B with ProB 1) Operations of a machine are
		  specified as generalised substitutions, which allow
		  deterministic and nondeterministic state transitions to be
		  specified. 2) There are two main proof activities in B:
		  consistency checking and refinement check (Atelier B and
		  B-Toolkit). ProB more focuses on consistency checking,
		  though it can support refinement check of B 3) ProB tool
		  supports automated consistency checking of B machines via
		  model checking 4) while B machines are good at modelling
		  parallel activity, they can be less convenient at modelling
		  sequential activity. This can be a lot less transparent
		  than the way in which one orders action execution in
		  process algebras such as CSP 5) This paper is to use CSP
		  and B together in a complementary way.
		  
		  B can be used to specify abstract state and can be used to
		  specify operations of a system in terms of their enabling
		  conditions and effect on the abstract state. CSP can be
		  used to give an overall specification of the coordination
		  of operations. The execution of an operation in a B machine
		  corresponds to an event in CSP terms. Semantically view B
		  machine as a process that can engage in events in the same
		  way that a CSP process can. The meaning of a combined CSP
		  and B specification is the parallel composition of both
		  specifications.
		  
		  The B machine and the CSP process must synchronise on
		  common events, that is, an operation can only happen in the
		  combined system when it is allowed both by the B and the
		  CSP. 6) CSP Intepreter and Animator (Design and
		  Implementation of the High-Level Specification Language
		  CSP(LP) in Prolog) + ProB together to animate and model
		  check the combination of CSP and B together. They are both
		  implemented with Prolog 7) Two main uses of combined CSP
		  and B tools (CIA and ProB): animate and model check
		  specifications which are a combination of B and CSP analyse
		  trace properties of a B machine. CSP to specify some
		  desirable or undesirable behaviours and use ProB to find
		  traces of the B machine that exhibit those behaviours 8)
		  Combination of B and CSP Combining State Information
		  Mapping Operations to Channels Deriving an Operational
		  Semantics Computing the Operational Semantics 9) Specifying
		  using B and CSP, and Verifying properties of B machines
		  using CSP: CSP to specify some desirable or undesirable
		  behaviours and use ProB to find traces of the B machine
		  that exhibit those behaviours. 10) Related works a. CSP2B
		  tool: specifications to be written in a combination of CSP
		  and B by compiling the CSP to a pure B representation which
		  can be analysed by a standard B tool. The CSP support by
		  csp2B is more restricted than that supported by ProB: csp2B
		  does not support internal choice and allows parallel
		  composition only at the outermost level unlike the
		  arbitrary combination of CSP operators supported by ProB b.
		  CSP||B: is focused on a style of combining CSP and B where
		  the B machines are passive and all the coordination is
		  provided by the CSP. This means the operations of their B
		  machines cannot be guarded though they can have
		  preconditions. c. CSP-OZ, (Object Z and CSP): treat Z
		  specifications as CSP processes and model the composition
		  of the CSP and Z parts as parallel composition. Like the
		  approach described in this paper d. Model check CSP-Z: an
		  approach to translating Z to CSP so that CSP-Z
		  specifications can be model checked. e. Circus language: is
		  a rich combination of Z and CSP allowing Z to be easily
		  embedded in CSP specifications and providing refinement
		  rules for development 11) ProB also supports refinement
		  checking between B models and between combinations of CSP
		  and B.}

  abstract = {{S}ince state-rich formalism {\Circus} is a combination of {Z}, {CSP}, refinement calculus and {D}ijkstra's guarded commands, its model checking is intrinsically more complicated and difficult than that of individual state-based languages or process algebras. {C}urrent solutions translate executable constructs of {\Circus} programs to {J}ava with {JCSP}, or translate them to {CSP} processes. {D}ata aspects of {\Circus} programs are expressed in the {J}ava programming language or as {CSP} processes. {B}oth of them have disadvantages. {T}his work presents a new approach to model-checking {\Circus} by linking it to ${CSP} {\parallel} {B}$; then we utilise {P}ro{B} to model-check and animate the ${CSP} {\parallel} {B}$ program. {T}he most significant advantage of this approach is the direct mapping of the state part in {\Circus} to {Z} and finally to {B}, which maintains the high-level abstraction of data specification. {I}n addition, introduction of deadlock, invariant violation checking, {LTL} formula checking and animation is another key advantage. {W}e present our approach, a link definition for a subset of {\Circus} constructs, as well as a popular case study (reactive buffer) to show the practical usability of our work. {W}e conclude with a discussion of related work, advantages and potential limitations of our approach and future work.},
